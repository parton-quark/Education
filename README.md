# Education

These notebooks was made for lectures of "Linear algebra" for undergraduate students.

Contents
* [PageRank](PageRank.ipynb)
Demonstration of PageRank algorithm, the core of the searching engine(Showing the calculation of teleportation matrix and link transition matrix).

* [Affine transformation](affine.ipynb)
By using affine transformation, we can perform change the scaling, rotation, and shear.
In this notebook, I performed those to a image.

* [Triangle Finding](triangle.ipynb)
By using the property of trace of matrices, we can count the number of triangles in a graph represented in adjacency matrix.

* [Dijkstra](dijkstra.ipynb)
Function of Dijkstra's algorithm of networkX.
